## General info

This is my version of Qatar football world cup 2022. The idea of this project is to follow draw groups, and then to follow the official rules of the world cup for the game. In .JSON file I have made a data-model for all teams, as well as their stats. Stats for every team is update after every played match. If a match is draw, the winning team is picked randomly. Take a look, its be fun.

## How to start

Just clone repo, and run in the browser. Then take a look in the console
